Running netmaps/regenerat_map.sh will cause data to be downloaded from CAIDA and other sources that will then be analyzed to generate the netmap site.

Please be aware that this script takes a very long time to run. 

After the script is complete, results are stored in netmaps/asn_web_graphs/results/results.xml

The directory netmaps/asn_web_graphs/ is the root of a PHP driven site that will display interactive visualizations of the data similar to those found on  http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/netmaps/

See also the git repo for the Flash based visualization used on the site. Its source is available at: https://github.com/berkmancenter/netmaps-visualization
